    "This notebook is part of a Wikidata information & training event at the University of Zurich on 14.9.2017 ([more details here](https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Wikidata:Events/Wikidata_Zurich)). Our goal is to help people interested in Wikidata, coding and open data in general, to get started with Wikidata as a source and platform for their projects. This workshop focuses on using the capabilities of the [MediaWiki API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Tutorial), as presented by [Cristina Sarasua](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Criscod) ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19eVu0IFdeB8gnSd7Nf0iLaPc0uh9lhIvgKUtp0Sghy0/edit#slide=id.g2545ae0d2e_0_22)), to extract entities and linked concepts from Wikidata.\n",

    "We will be using the [Python programming language](https://python.org) for our demonstration, popular with academic, industrial and hobby/beginner users alike, it lends itself well to the task of connecting to Internet data sources and doing some analysis or visualisation. The example code here should run in any modern Python interpreter, available on most computing platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.). We particularly encourage you to try [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org), which makes working with this kind of Python project especially pleasant.\n",
    "\n",
    "For participants of the workshop, we have set up a shared \"Jupyter Hub\" server, so you don't need to prepare anything except Internet connectivity and a reasonably modern web browser on your laptop. For those who wish to run set up their own environment in a short amount of time, check out the official [installation guide](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) which suggests the use of [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), or cloud-based offerings from [Sandstorm.io](https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/rprqf3t2h3vd3swfkhwk076qrennh9msreyjv70g7sgw5hkdxjph), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/using-tensorflow-jupyterhub-classrooms), [Microsoft Azure](https://notebooks.azure.com/) or [Domino Data Lab](https://www.dominodatalab.com/trial/)."

    "A little bird lives in the big city of Zürich, thirsting for knowledge .. in particular, for knowledge of reliable water sources, ideally near to works of art like monuments which may feature kindly and generous Breakers-of-bread. Let's find out where a bird can get a drink, by consulting the world's greatest crowdsourced encyclopaedia: Wikipedia. Since our persistent and skillful friend is unfortunately not that experienced in using Web browsers, googling for answers, and other strange tools of the Breakers-of-bread, he will need something a little more basic. And, perhaps, a little more visual. Luckily for him, [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) is here to help: by creating **structured data**, the collected knowledge of Wikipedia can be reused in infinite other ways. Let's dig in!"

    "## Learning the API\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction, Wikidata fits into the overall architecture of MediaWiki, the system behind Wikipedia and its many sibling sites. If you know your way around Wikipedia, you should find it relatively straightforward to use the [API Sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ApiSandbox) along with the [tips here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Search_and_discovery) to come up with some interesting queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be more precise and avoid the ambiguity of free-text search, let's break down our interests by topics in Wikidata:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Zurich - Q72](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q72)\n",
    "- [water - Q283](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q283)\n",
    "- [fountain - Q483453](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q483453)\n",
    "- [public art - Q557141](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q557141)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've pinpointed a few starting places in the tree of knowledge, we can run some [Wikidata API](https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php) queries to get information about these subjects. MediaWiki's API is language-angostic, that is, it can be accessed using **any programming language** which supports the widespread [RESTful API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) standard. You shouldn't need to know much about this unless you are a Web developer, you can safely assume that it will \"just work\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the programming language, there will be libraries which give you a little more support. In Python, such APIs are often accessed using [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/). This comes standard in most installations and frameworks, or can be easily added to your system. The call to the Wikidata API to obtain details on our first item would look like this: "
